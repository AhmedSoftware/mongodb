Issues seen with https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/:
1) The package does not create /data/db
2) The package does not create a service unit for systemd
3) Because of the issue in #2, trying to removing mongo package causes a failure in /var/lib/dpkg/info/mongodb-org-server.prerm
  and makes it impossible to remove it or reinstall mongo from the default package repository without editing that file
 
 #3 Error: 
 
Failed to stop mongod.service: Unit mongod.service not loaded.
invoke-rc.d: initscript mongod, action "stop" failed.
dpkg: error processing package mongodb-org-server (--remove):
 installed mongodb-org-server package pre-removal script subprocess returned error exit status 5

Unrelated, but having issues in your project would probably be helpful for reporting issues like these
