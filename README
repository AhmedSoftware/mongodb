32 BIT BUILD NOTES

  MongoDB uses memory mapped files.  If built as a 32 bit executable, you will
  not be able to work with large (multi-gigabyte) databases.  However, 32 bit
  builds work fine with small development databases.

THIS IS A JOSUE FIGUEROA CONTRIBUTION:
  
  To start making contributions to MongoDB, first, I forked the mongo repository. This will allow
  me to make contibutions without access to the souce repository:
  
  https://github.com/jfigueroagama/mongo
  
  After I forked the mongo repository, I cloned the repository locally in my machine to create a branch
  "JosueFigueroaContributions" and make my contributions in this branch locally:
  
  MacBook-Josue:MyMongo josue$ git branch
* JosueFigueroaContributions
  v2.6.3
MacBook-Josue:MyMongo josue$ 
  
  Once my first contribution is done, then, I can check the status to review the changes I made. In this case,
  the changes are only in the README file: 
  
 MacBook-Josue:MyMongo josue$ git status
On branch JosueFigueroaContributions
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   README

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
MacBook-Josue:MyMongo josue$ 

  Now, I cam commit my changes:
